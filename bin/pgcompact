=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<pgcompact> is a tool to reduce bloat for tables and indexes without
heavy locks.

Initially the tool is an automation of the solutions proposed in these
publications:

=over 4

=item L<Reducing bloat without locking|http://blog.endpoint.com/2010/09/reducing-bloat-without-locking.html>

by Joshua Tolley (on End Point's blog)

=item L<Reduce bloat of table without long/exclusive locks|http://depesz.com/index.php/2010/10/17/reduce-bloat-of-table-without-longexclusive-locks>

by Hubert Lubaczewski (aka Depesz).

=back

If pgstattuple is installed B<pgcompact> uses it to get a better
statistics. It is highly recommended to be for TOASTed tables and
indexes.

=head1 EXAMPLES

Shows usage manual.

	pgcompact --man

Compacts all the bloated tables in all the database in the cluster
plus their bloated indexes. Prints additional progress information.

	pgcompact --all --reindex --verbose info

Compacts all the bloated tables in the billing database and their
bloated indexes excepts ones that are in the pgq schema.

	pgcompact --dbname billing --exclude-schema pgq --reindex

=head1 OPTIONS

=head2 General options

=over 4

=item B<-?>

=item B<--help>

Display short help.

=item B<-m>

=item B<--man>

Display full manual.

=item B<-V>

=item B<--version>

Print version.

=item B<-q>

=item B<--quiet>

Do not display progress messages. The same as C<-v warning>.

=item B<-v> LEVEL

=item B<--verbosity> LEVEL

A verbosity level. One of C<error>, C<warning>, C<notice>, C<info>,
C<debug0> and C<debug1>. By default C<notice>.

=back

=head2 Connection options

The B<pgcompact> tries to connect to the database with the DBI Perl
module using either DBD::Pg or DBD::PgPP driver first. If it fails the
utility tries to work via psql using bidirectional communications.

If some of the connection options is not specified the tool tries to
get it from C<PGHOST>, C<PGPORT>, C<PGUSER>, C<PGPASSWORD> environment
variables. If password is still unknown after that than it tries to
get it from the password file that C<PGPASSFILE> refers to and if this
file does not exist it tries to get it from C<HOME/.pgpass> file.

=over 4

=item B<-h> HOST

=item B<--host> HOST

A database host. By default C<localhost>.

=item B<-p> PORT

=item B<--port> PORT

A database port. By default C<5432>.

=item B<-U> USER

=item B<--user> USER

A database user. By default current system user is used (as returned
by whoami).

=item B<-W> PASSWD

=item B<--password> PASSWD

A password for the user.

=item B<-P> PATH

=item B<--path-to-psql> PATH

A path to the psql program. By default C<psql>.

=head2 Targeting options

Note that if you specified a database, schema or table that is not in
the cluster it will be ignored. Redundant exclusions will be ignored
too. All these options except C<--all> can be specified several times.

=over 4

=item B<-a>

=item B<--all>

Process all the databases in the cluster.

=item B<-d> DBNAME

=item B<--dbname> DBNAME

A database to process. By default all the user databses of the
instance are processed.

=item B<-D> DBNAME

=item B<--exclude-dbname> DBNAME

A database to exclude from processing.

=item B<-n> SCHEMA

=item B<--schema> SCHEMA

A schema to process. By default all the schemas of the specified
database are processed.

=item B<-N> SCHEMA

=item B<--exclude-schema> SCHEMA

A schema to exclude from processing.

=item B<-t> TABLE

=item B<--table> TABLE

A table to process. By default all the tables of the specified schema
are processed.

=item B<-T> TABLE

=item B<--exclude-table> TABLE

A table to exclude from processing.

=head2 Options controlling the behaviour

=over 4

=item B<-u>

=item B<--dry-run>

Print statistics only, without affecting any data.

=item B<-I>

=item B<--no-initial-vacuum>

=item B<-R>

=item B<--no-routine-vacuum>

Turn off the initial/routine vacuum. By default all the vacuums are
on. Final vacuum can not be turned off.

=item B<-L>

=item B<--no-final-analyze>

Turn off the final analyze. By default the final analyze is performed.

=item B<-S>

=item B<--no-pgstattuple>

Do not use pgstattuple even if it is installed. By default is off.

=item B<-C>

=item B<--system-catalog>

Warning! This feature is experimental, use at your own risk.

Allow tables from system catalog to be processed as well. It does not
process pg_indexes, as it txid dependant. By default it is off.

=item B<-r>

=item B<--reindex>

Reindex tables after processing.

=item B<-s>

=item B<--print-reindex-queries>

Print reindex queries. Useful if you want to perform manual
reindex later.

=item B<-f>

=item B<--force>

Try to compact even those tables and indexes that do not meet minimal
bloat requirements.

=item B<-c> PAGES

=item B<--max-pages-per-round> PAGES

An upper threshold of pages to process per round. By default it is 10.

=item B<-e> SECONDS

=item B<--delay-constant> SECONDS

A constant part of the delay between rounds in seconds. By default it
is 0.

=item B<-E> RATIO

=item B<--delay-ratio> RATIO

A dynamic part of the delay between rounds is calculated as
previous-round-time * delay-ratio. By default 2.

=item B<-o> COUNT

=item B<--max-retry-count> COUNT

A maximum number of retries in case of unsuccessful processing. By
default 10.

=item B<-x> COUNT

=item B<--min-page-count> COUNT

A minumum pages number required to be in a table or index for
processing. By default it is 10.

=item B<-y> RATIO

=item B<--min-free-percent> RATIO

A minimum free space percent required to be in a table or index for
processing. By default it is 20.

=item B<-z> SECONDS

=item B<--progress-report-period> SECONDS

An interval in seconds to report the progress. Default is 60 seconds.
